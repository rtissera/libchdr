/* 1 = CD codecs keep a private hunk-sized scratch buffer and write the
 * caller's buffer once at the end; 0 = decode into the caller's buffer and
 * spread the sectors out in place, which needs only a frame-sized scratch.
 *
 * The in-place spread cuts peak heap on an open CD image by roughly 40%, and
 * because what it stops allocating is a hunk-sized block per codec it also
 * leaves the largest free block substantially bigger, which is what decides
 * whether a later allocation of that size succeeds. It costs a few percent of
 * decode time.
 *
 * So it is off wherever RAM is not the binding constraint, and on under
 * LOWRAM_TARGET, where it is - the same trade the other LOWRAM_TARGET levers
 * make. Set it explicitly to override either default.
 *
 * See chd_read() in chd.h for what it asks of the caller's buffer. */

/* Trade CPU for RAM across several independent levers, for targets with a

 *    (12 bytes/hunk for CHDv5, ~24 bytes/hunk for legacy v1-v4 - scales
 *    with total hunk count, independent of codec/hunkbytes choice, and
 *    can reach multiple MB on full-size CD/GD-ROM/UMD images), keep only
 *    a sparse checkpoint index and re-derive individual entries on
 *    demand. See LOWRAM_TARGET_CHECKPOINT_STRIDE to tune the RAM/CPU
 *    tradeoff.
 * 2. Each huffman_decoder's lookup table: a two-level table instead of
 *    a full 2^maxbits direct table - see LOWRAM_TARGET_HUFFMAN_L1BITS
 *    below.
 * 3. The compressed-hunk scratch buffer (chd->compressed,
 *    src/libchdr_chd.c): grown on demand to the largest hunk actually
 *    read instead of preallocated to header.hunkbytes at chd_open().

 * 2^L1BITS first-level table, escaping to small per-prefix subtables only
 * for the rare codes longer than L1BITS. Huffman assigns short codes to
 * common symbols by construction, so the fast (non-escaping) path is
