	/* One decompression context serves both the sector-data and subcode
	 * streams under LOWRAM_TARGET, halving the codec's context memory.
	 *
	 * Safe because the two streams are decoded strictly in sequence by
	 * cd_codec_decompress() - base to completion, error returns early, then
	 * subcode - never nested and never concurrently, into disjoint halves of
	 * `buffer`; and because the decompress entry point re-initialises the
	 * context on entry, so no state carries from one stream to the other.
	 *
	 * It is not free: alternating two differently-shaped streams through one
	 * context costs measurably more CPU than giving each its own, because the
	 * context's working set is rebuilt each way: measured on x86-64 over a
	 * whole file, +3.9%. A ZSTD_DCtx is ~94KB, so on a memory-constrained
	 * part that is a good trade and on a desktop it is not - hence
	 * LOWRAM_TARGET, which exists to make exactly this choice. A default
	 * build keeps two contexts and its previous speed.
	 *
	 * The same sharing was tried for cdzl and reverted: an inflate context is
	 * only ~8KB once the unused 32KB dictionary is gone, so paying 2.6% CPU
	 * for it is not worth it.
	 *
	 * NOTE for anyone adding threading (see the pread work in PR #162):
	 * codec state is already shared across concurrent chd_read() calls, but
	 * this removes even the accidental separation between base and subcode.
	 * Per-thread codec state has to mean per-thread codec instances. */
